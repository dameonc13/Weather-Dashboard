# Weather-Dashboard

With this application you will be able to get latest weather for any city in United States



# Description 
In this project I  create a user interface weather dashboard. The user can search for weather information on any city in America. The user can get weather information such as the 

current weather and five day forecast. This can be perfect for road trips or preparing for work in the morning. With its responsiveness the user can use the website on their phone with 

no problems. 


# Functionality 

The user is presented  with the current day and five-day forecast. The information the user is presented with is fetch from the openWeatherMap api, this is the first project where 
an api is used in one of my project. 

Every search will append below the search button. The user can click on each previous search which will then load the current and five-day forecast for the city clicked on.
