# Weather-Dashboard

In this project i create a user interface weather dashboard. The user can search for weather information on any city in America. When the user clicks the search button the user will be

presented  with the current day and five-day forecast. The information the user is presented with is fetch from the openweathermap api, this is the first project where an api is used. 

Every search will append below the search button. The user can click on each previous search which will then load the current and five-day forecast for the city clicked on. 

In this project aside from using ajax i also used Html, Javascript, CSS and CSS framework Bootstrap.
